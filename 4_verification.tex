% \chapter{Component and system verification}

% In this chapter, whole system design verification is described. 


% \section{Space segment verification}

% Satellite communication subsystem have to be thoroughly tested on the ground, as once sent nothing can be changed or fixed. High quality measurements are required to verify functionality of the system in the changing environment.

% \subsection{Flatsat}

% Most of the tests were performed on Flatsat (an abbreviation from Flat Satellite), an electronic test bench, which consist of mix of flight models, engineering models of the instruments and Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE). EGSE are the test instruments and/or mocks (fake) instruments, which allow testing without the need for actual hardware.

% PW-Sat2 Flatsat was integrated in Space Research Centre in Warsaw. Flatsat is shown in the figure \ref{TODO}.

% \subsubsection{Flatsat Ground Station mock}
% To perform the communication tests a Ground Station mock was created of flatsat. It was built using to Software-Defined Radios: one, as downlink receiver, same as to be installed in the Ground Station (Funcube Pro+), and the second (PlutoSDR) to generate uplink signals. Use of SDR instead of analogue radio transceiver greatly simplified the tests performed. Ground station mock is shown in the figure \ref{TODO}.
