\chapter{Introduction}
In satellite applications, radio communication is usually the only way of communications between a spacecraft and the control systems here on Earth. This means that all the commands issued by the operator and the telemetry and experiment data we can gather has to go through the radio link. Also the satellite housekeeping data, important for the estimation of the satellites' health are required to be download to the operator via radio link. For many missions, lack of radio communication with satellite causes the mission to fail, as there is no possibility to download experiment data, even if they can be carried out automatically.

\section{Scope of the thesis}
The aim of this thesis was to design, verify, validate and deploy the communication system for second Polish satellite, PW-Sat2. The design covers all aspects of communication link design from the system point of view: the link design, space and ground segments and testing all the subsystems. Thesis should describe the choices and the practical design of the low-cost satellite link using both off-the-shelf hardware, custom designed components and Software Defined Radio, with custom digital signal processing. The designed system should provide a two-way data link between the operator and the satellite. Finally, the system was tested on the orbit, proving its parameters and reliability.
